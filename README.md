## Development Process

### **1. Planning & Requirements**
The first step in the development process involved gathering the client’s requirements and understanding the business goals. Based on the provided **Figma design**, I outlined the key features needed for the website, including the integration of the CRM system, the creation of landing pages, and the need for performance optimization.

### **2. Design & Customization**

The goal was to provide a clean, easy-to-navigate design while focusing on the client’s brand aesthetics and user experience.

### **3. CRM & Marketing Integration**
One of the primary requirements of this project was the seamless integration of a CRM for lead tracking. I integrated **Go High Level CRM**, allowing the business to track patient inquiries and follow up with leads in a timely manner.
